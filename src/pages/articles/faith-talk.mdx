"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exist"
Hebrew 11: 1
International Standard Version

Faith is calling the things that be not as though they are. Making the invisible visible. 
Believing that something good will come, great things will happen that will bring about a positive transformation is an act of faith. Those on this table are merely projecting their inner impulses, what they believe and accept to be true, valid and achievable. What they cannot see, but which they know exist.

The question of what influences them is of no signicance in this piece. Anyone can be influenced by whatever they are exposed to or surrounded with. Even Adolf Hitler has his influence, but we are concerned about the outcome of his actions.

Pessimism on the other hand according to my educated opinion, is also an act of faith. Believing that something will not work, that accident will happen, that an individual will die on that hospital bed is an act of faith. Anyone entangled with this thought is as faithful as those on the other hand of the cross. It is a question of beliefs. 

Two thieves hanged on a tree sandwiched in between an acclaimed holy man, a saviour. The first question one may want to ask is, what made the holy man to be hanged with thieves? Does holiness not mean an aversion to everything unacceptable in a society and to God? Sorry, that's a digression! 

The thieves believed differently. One believe that in spite of all he was accused and punished for, he still has a right to ask for favour. Another believe he is condemned and sentenced to hell, so doesn't have any moral right to ask for favour. They're both right, it is faith in action.

Just like the two thieves, when you step out each day of your life, your faith will be called into action from time to time. You will need to call forth those things that be not as though they were. One of Optimism or Pessimism will be your response and it is what your life will produce.

So enjoy the proceeds of your faith in action. Wishing you the best of your choices in life.
