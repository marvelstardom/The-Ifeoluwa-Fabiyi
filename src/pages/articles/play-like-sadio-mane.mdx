In the jungle, whether you see yourself as a Gazelle or as a Lion, you must keep running to live. The day you decides to stop, you are either eaten or you die from hunger! 

The whistle has been blown already. 
Meanwhile, while we were still in the dressing room,  individually, many of us perfected our plans for this second half. 
The REFEREE (GOD) has blown the whistle. Our COACH (for those who have sha) has outlined the game plan for us... It is COUNTER ATTACK tactics we want to use. The earlier we SCORE THE FIRST GOAL the easier it becomes to score others. 
We will not do like Arsenal (all play and no goal)...No time to do yenyenyen again. It is vawulence pro max.
 Do you have a Coach? (Mentors, and Role Models)...abi ko necesri.
On the pitch, Coach or no Coach... As individual player on the pitch (life), you must have your own plans. HOW MANY GOALS do you want to score in a day? Hat trick or film trick?
You cannot just be following the crowd like sheep with no direction or a Porsche with no break when you are not LUKAKU...that will be tantamount to a breakneck speed into abyss and great beyond.
But, wait let me confess:
I have wasted efforts and a lot of scoring chances in the first half. Do I still have hope bayi?
Don't worry, even best players miss too. 
This second half... Get ready, no smile and no joy like MANE...no show off or playing to the gallery like NEYMAR... get the goals first. Later, you can cruise and chill with the big boys. 
The end will justify the means.
I want you to imagine playing football on a pitch and there is no goalpost, no monkey pole or even stones that depicts where to score a goal....
You will carry the ball, dribble, run and mesmerize everyone watching you, you will display skills no man has ever seen, showcase talent like Talentdinho from one end of the pitch to the other... After a while, you will get tired and worn out.
You know why? No GOALPOST. There is no GOAL you are aiming to score, you are just playing.
There can't be GOALS if there is no GOALPOST.
It is not enough to work. You must know why you are working.
There must be GOALS you wish to score with the work you are engage in. 
In 2 years? In 5 years? In 10 years? 
What are your goals?
The match has started already. 
Play it like Mane.
