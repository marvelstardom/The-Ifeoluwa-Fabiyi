## What Do I Mean?

A phase of life is called the Age of Innocence. It is that phase where you are blank. 'Tabularaza" You know nothing, and you are nothing other than a breathing organism. You have your way at that phase by crying. Your only goals and biggest aspirations at that phase are to eat, sleep and suck breast, and your only tool and strategy to achieve them is to cry.
Parents are happy that you cry to get their attention. They rush helter skelter and scatter things to attend to your needs. They fall head over heels and ensure you smile for them.

Zoooooooooooooooom!
You become a Pre Teen. And because the cry strategy has worked perfectly at the previous stage, your brain automatically stored it up as the master plan to getting things done quickly. Now when you need to buy chocolate, you press the Cry Cry button and mehhh mehhh...you began.

Your father on hearing that, rush towards you and with joy in your heart concealed with tears, you are happy that you will get chocolate. Gbas gbos, gbos gbas...it is Igbaju pro max daddy gave you. You wondered what you did wrong. Dad must be very wicked.
Mum showed up and you push the Cry Cry button again....but against everything you know and mastered at the previous stage of life....Mum rush you with Igbaju, Igbati, Igbarun, Igbamu, Igbadi...

Ahahahahahah....You raised your voice. Kill me ooo, kill me. In your innocence, you asked what did I do wrong now? Why are you beating me?
Now because you asked, you will receive the answer.
At the stage of Innocence, Parents indulge your excesses. But at Pre Teen, they expect you to learn to SPEAK UP and ask for what you want and Need. The method and approach at a phase don't always work at another phase, you may need to re-strategize. They tell you, son, if you cry again in this house over flimsy things, iku pa e.

At the childhood phase of existence, life indulge your excesses. But at Pre Teen, you will chop beating.
"When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me."
